# Get some free AR: An Arweave faucet tutorial

# You no longer need the AR faucet, head to the [KOII Faucet tutorial](https://blog.koii.network/How-To-Get-Free-Koi-A-Faucet-Wallet-Tutorial/) to get KOII Now!

Since Koii works as a layer on top of Arweave, you need a small amount of AR to register your content on the Koii Network. Luckily, you can get a free AR wallet (perfect for storing KOII too) and some AR for free from the [Arweave faucet](https://faucet.arweave.net/).

_It only takes a few steps but if you’re new to blockchain, it can be confusing_.

Once you’re at the [Arweave faucet](https://faucet.arweave.net/), select the checkbox and then click the Continue button.

Next you create an AR wallet by selecting the checkbox (again) and clicking “Download Wallet.” This will appear as a .JSON file. For the less tech-savvy of us, you don’t need to open the file or do anything with it other than putting it in a safe folder.

Save the keyfile somewhere safe! Keeping a copy of the file on 2-3+ devices is recommended because no one can retrieve or recover it for you if you lose it. All your tokens would disappear with the wallet.

_Click “Next.”_

Now you will have to verify that you are a real person by tweeting from an active Twitter account. Click “Open Tweet Pop-Up.” The pop-up may prompt you to log in to Twitter.

If you’re a pretty active tweet-er, you’ll already be logged in and all you have to do is click “Tweet” in the Twitter pop up, then “Next” in the Arweave faucet flow.

After successfully tweeting, click _“Next”_.

You’ll then get a success message and you’ll have a bit of AR in your new Arweave Wallet!

Now let’s head over to the [KOII Faucet Tutorial](/How-To-Get-Free-Koii-A-Faucet-Wallet-Tutorial/) to get some KOII tokens.
