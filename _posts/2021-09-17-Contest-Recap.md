On Aug 20, 2021 the #Koiicares contest began.

The goal ? We wanted to inspire our creative community to put the Koii Network to use. From day one we saw submissions that reflected a wide variety of concepts and artistic styles, from handcrafted wares to ultramodern 3D renders. We were ecstatic to see so many new users mention that this was the first time they had ever minted an NFT. The Koii team has worked hard to make minting digital art as an NFT as painless and accessible as possible while keeping the process economical and environmentally friendly. Seeing so many new creators share their works using Koii gave our team a huge boost!

Each day of the contest we saw new and unique submissions that kept us in eager anticipation of what would be posted next. Among the highlights were fascinating interpretations of the Koii logo with subtle nods to decentralization and data permanence. Throughout the contest, we came to appreciate that digital art can be created and interpreted in a wide variety of ways. You showed us that whether something is designed in the digital realm or the physical - with Koii you can share it all.

Although the contest has come to a close, the best thing about sharing your works on Koii is that you can enjoy it forever, maintain ownership and receive rewards for the views your work attracts going forward. If you are new to Koii and would like to learn more about how our Atomic NFTs work you can head over to atomicnft.com or you can install our Koii Finnie wallet and try minting an Atomic NFT on Koii for free.

We hope the contest inspired all of you as it did us.
