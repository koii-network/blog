We have an exciting new feature to share: custom tasks are here! Custom tasks are tasks that you can run using the task’s ID, streamlining development and community engagement. They don’t show up on your “Add Tasks” page, but they are live on the network.

Launching custom tasks mean two things for our community:

1. If you’re building, testing your tasks just got a lot easier. You can run your task on your personal node and your team’s nodes before it gets reviewed and allow-listed by the Koii team.
2. If you have an existing community that you want to run your task, you can bring them onboard to run it without making it available for the wider community.

If you’re writing a task, make sure to create a thorough task description, that includes

- What your task does,
- How rewards are distributed, and
- Why you need each task setting you use.

Then share it with your community, friends and family, anyone who can help further your mission! We are happy to have them on board and will help support your growth as best we can.

Using the custom task feature is simple. **Any task you run this way has not been vetted or audited by the Koii team.**

**Only run a custom task if you fully trust the creators.**

First, click on “Advanced” at the bottom of the “Add Tasks” page.

Next, enter the TaskID. You will get this from the trusted task creator. If the ID matches any task in the network, you will see the stake minimum and any necessary task settings pop up.

Now this task is just like any other task. Enter the amount you want to stake and pair any required settings.

After you set your stake and pair any settings, all that’s left to do is hit “run.” While a very simple feature to use, it’s a powerful tool for projects who are just getting started.

As a reminder, **make sure you trust the task creator** when running a custom task. These tasks have not yet been audited by the team.

If you have any questions, want to learn more about how to use this feature, or want to learn how to create your own tasks, jump in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/{{ site.discord.invite }}){:target="\_blank"}.

If you got the far in the post, here’s a little sneak peek treat. We are working on a referral code system that allows you to share a specific task in onboarding when someone downloads their node for the first time. It’s a complicated, but exciting process so stay tuned!
