# What you do online is an extension of yourself...

A few years ago I had a conversation with a friend of mine regarding data collection, at the time I ignorantly said, “who cares, I have nothing to hide”, as he tried to explain the significance of collecting user data especially when one single entity was doing it.

**When did the consumer become the product?**

Like me, a lot of people still have this mindset. When we go on our phones and scroll through Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter, we believe we are the consumer. Instead, we are the product.

What you do online is an extension of yourself, so what you search, like, post, and share is essentially a meta version of you. Big tech companies (like Facebook) are centralized and their network runs on company servers, meaning that all your information is stored in one place and only they have the key.

What does this mean? It means that all your data is being collected, your habits are being studied, and a single entity essentially knows your every move. In a time when knowledge is power, this type of control is more relevant than ever.

When spending habits, behaviors, likes, and dislikes are all in one place it becomes very easy for someone to take this information and profile us. From sponsored ads on Instagram and Facebook to Google searches, every click is money going into corporations' pockets.

**How can we fix this problem?**

Why do we give so much power to centralized media companies when we should benefit from the attention generated on their platforms? Why do these companies have such a vast amount of our data? Why do we allow them to exploit us?
