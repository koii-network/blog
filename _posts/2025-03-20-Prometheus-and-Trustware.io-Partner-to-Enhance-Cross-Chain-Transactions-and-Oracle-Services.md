Prometheus is excited to announce a strategic partnership with Trustware.io, the innovative developer behind the "Just Send It" payments protocol. This collaboration will integrate advanced cross-chain transactions and decentralized Oracle services into the Prometheus ecosystem, strengthening interoperability across major blockchains, including Koii Network. Additionally, Koii Node operators will gain new revenue opportunities by running Trustware Oracles and contributing to their development.

Trustware allows users to send assets from anywhere to anything, without requiring prior relationships, often routing transactions through multiple blockchain hops via Axelar. With the integration of Allbridge, Trustware.io will now enable seamless transactions to and from Koii, enhancing Prometheus SDK capabilities. Allbridge’s powerful cross-chain bridging, already supporting major ecosystems, ensures that transactions between Koii, Avalanche, Polkadot, Polygon, and Stellar are faster, cheaper, and more private than ever before.

Beyond payments, Trustware.io is launching a revolutionary Oracle framework, offering private cross-chain messaging through personalized Oracle nodes. These nodes require operators to maintain and secure the network, making Koii Nodes an ideal fit. Operators will earn Trustware tokens for running Oracles and assisting in debugging and development via Prometheus tasks. Additionally, the "Just Fucking Send It" protocol will be integrated directly into Finnie, Koii’s Desktop Node, and the Prometheus SDK, further enhancing transaction efficiency and decentralized finance interoperability.

This partnership represents a major step forward for decentralized finance, offering a more efficient, secure, and scalable way to move assets across blockchains. With multiple revenue streams for Koii Node operators and deeper integration into Prometheus technology, Trustware.io and Koii are together shaping the future of open, decentralized financial systems.
