### Who are you?

Hi! I'm Taylor Anderson. I'm a pixel artist and game developer out of Toronto. I make small, cute games and animations.

<br>

## What makes you want to make stuff?

Honestly it's just kind of how my brain functions! Whenever I read something, or play something, or watch something, a lot of the time my mind just inevitably wanders to something I'd want to make with those inspirations.

<br>

## What are you working on right now?

I'm working on a set of virtual trading cards! They're a series of slime monsters doing various silly things. I think it's really funny that slimes are considered these fearsome creatures, when for the most part they are essentially less-dangerous jelly fish just doin their thing. To that end the cards I'm creating are essentially Pokemon spoofs, but where most Pokemon actually have cool moves with damage and effects, these slimes are virtually useless. They're just hanging out.

Much of my pixelart is done in the process of making a game, so it was really fun to take a step back from that and just do some art for the sake of it.

<br>

## What bothers you about the NFT space?

Wow, a ton of stuff! It bothers me that, in this age of runaway climate change, NFT's are overwhelmingly using Ethereum, a proof of work system that sucks up a massive amount of energy. It bothers me that a tooon of work being put up for sale is straight up stolen from other sources. It bothers me that people who should know better are contributing to these spaces, all in the name of making a few bucks. I think if the NFT space is going to continue, it needs to be massively reshapen to fix these issues.

<br>

## What is your hope or vision for Koii?

That Koii can help reshape the NFT space! (wow, what a great segue). As I mentioned, the NFT space is busted and I think Koii has the right values to carve a path forward -- from verifying using proof-of-real-traffic and proof-of-storage instead of proof-of-work, to prioritizing artist ownership. I can only hope that the rest of the crypto art space learns from Koii.
