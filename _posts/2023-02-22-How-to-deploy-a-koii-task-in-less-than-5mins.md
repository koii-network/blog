Koii Tasks allow communities around the world to pool computing resources towards common goals. Anyone with a basic understanding of JavaScript [can easily start hacking](https://docs.koii.network/microservices-and-tasks/quote-of-the-day-example-task), and we're here to help on our [discord](https://discord.gg/koii) if you have questions.

If you want to try the process out, the [create-task-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@_koii/create-task-cli) tool is a great place to start. This article will demonstrate how to use this tool. If you haven't already written a task, you can also try deploying the [sample task](https://github.com/koii-network/task-template) to get started.

Before proceeding, it is important to note that each Koii task has metadata that is typically stored on [IPFS](https://ipfs.tech/). We prefer [web3.storage](https://web3.storage/) for a smooth experience. So, if you don't already have one, set up a [web3.storage account](https://web3.storage/login/) now.

The process will ask for your Koii wallet path and may cause amount of KOII. Check our [Koii CLI Tool](https://docs.koii.network/koii-software-toolkit-sdk/using-the-cli) to generate a Koii Wallet. Also Check our [Faucet](https://docs.koii.network/koii-software-toolkit-sdk/wallet-and-faucet) to get some KOII.

If you have any feedback on the model, we'd love hear what you think. Koii Improvement Proposals can be submitted by [creating a new issue here](https://github.com/koii-network/koii-improvement-proposals), and most are likely to receive grants from the Koii Foundation.

# Installation

The first step is to install the create-task-cli tool, run the command below to install it:

```
npm i -g @_koii/create-task-cli
```

# Build the Task Executable

The [executable](https://docs.koii.network/microservices-and-tasks/task-development-guide/executable-structure) is the core of your Koii Task, and will control what nodes do as they're participating in your community. This is where you can [set incentives](https://docs.koii.network/microservices-and-tasks/quote-of-the-day-example-task/submit-distribution-list) and [define audits](https://docs.koii.network/microservices-and-tasks/task-development-guide/executable-structure/validate-node) to slash stake in event of an attack.

To build your executable out of a task project, which may be many files, we use webpack. If you're using the [task template](), there's a built-in script for this which you can run with:
`yarn run webpack:prod`

If you're not using the task executable, you'll need to webpack your project yourself, which you can do by copying the `webpack.config.js` file [here](https://github.com/koii-network/task-template/blob/master/webpack.config.js).

# Deploying a Task

After installing the CLI tool successfully, run the command below:

```
create-task-cli
```

After running the command above, you'll be required to provide answers for the following prompts:

1.  **Enter the path to your wallet** — Here you will add the path to your Koii wallet. E.g "/Users/< YOUR_HOME >/.config/koii/id.json"
2.  **Select operation** — Select _"Create a new task"_ option.
3.  **Enter the name of the task** — Add a name for your task; all tasks have a name, which can be anything, for example, "extremely-fast-task," "dogs-vs-cats."
4.  **Enter a short description of your task** — Add a brief explanation of your task.
5.  **Enter the network to be used to upload your executable [IPFS / ARWEAVE / DEVELOPMENT]** — Choose IPFS or ARWEAVE for storage of your executable file, or DEVELOPMENT if you haven’t developed your task yet.

    > Note — The next prompt is determined by your response to the previous prompt.

6.  [For *IPFS*] **Enter the web3.storage API key** — Create an API Token for your project on your web3.storage dashboard, then paste it into this prompt. Create a [web3.storage account](https://web3.storage/login/).
7.  [For *ARWEAVE*] **Enter Arweave id of the deployed Koii task executable program** — Upload your task executable to [Arweave](https://www.arweave.org/) and add the ID to the uploaded file to this prompt.
8.  [For *DEVELOPMENT*] **Enter the name of executable you want to run on task-nodes** — Enter a desired name for your task executable, this will be the same name of the executable file that will exist in the task node's executables folder.
9.  [For *IPFS* and *ARWEAVE*] **Enter the path to your executable webpack** — Add the absolute path to your task executable file. E.g: "/Users/< YOUR HOME >/Documents/testing-task/dist/main.js"
10. **Enter the round time in slots** — Enter your preferred number of slots per round. E.g: 1000
11. **Enter the audit window in slots** — Enter the number of slots to be allocated to the audit window. E.g: 500
12. **Enter the submission window in slots** — Enter the number of slots to be allocated to the submission window. E.g: 300

    > Note — The number of slots in the audit window and submission must be lower than the number of slots per round.

13. **Enter the minimum staking amount in roes** — Enter the minimum amount of KOII that node operators should be able to stake on the task. E.g: 50
14. **Enter the total bounty you want to allocate for the task (In KOII)** — Any amount not more than what you have in your wallet though. E.g: 1000 (We suggest the amount could be run at least 4 epochs)
15. **Enter the bounty amount per round** — Total amount would be divided equally for each number until the bounty fund is exhausted. E.g: 10
16. **Enter TaskMetadata CID hosted on IPFS (Leave empty for None)** — Click the _"Upload Files"_ button on your web3.storage account, and then upload a JSON file containing the metadata for your task. In this prompt, enter the CID for the uploaded file. Here's an [example of metadata](https://docs.koii.network/microservices-and-tasks/what-are-tasks/key-components#metadata).
17. **Enter CID for environment variables hosted on IPFS (Leave empty for None)** — If your task requires environment variables to be run by node runners, upload a JSON file that contains those variables to IPFS using web3.storage. Add the CID of the uploaded file to this prompt.
18. **Enter the space, you want to allocate for task account (in MBs)** — Each task would need some storage for persistence, enter the size in MBs. E.g: 50

After the final confirmation of `y`, your task would be created along with a `taskStateInfoKeypair.json` which is used to control the task state info.

_Note:_ Make sure to keep this taskStateInfoKeypair.json safe

The output of the command should be similar to the following.

```bash=
> task-contract@0.0.1 start
> ts-node src/main.ts
