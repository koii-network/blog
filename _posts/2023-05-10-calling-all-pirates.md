At Koii Network, we value our community and want to reward those who are dedicated and passionate about our mission to take back the internet for the people who use it. That's why we're excited to introduce our new pirate uprising!

We would have called you ambassadors, but ambassadors are for governments. We are a pirate ship. This uprising features three stages that allow our most engaged and knowledgeable community members to level up and enjoy exclusive benefits and opportunities. The three phases are Deckhand, Master-at-Arms, and Buccaneer.

Let's take a closer look at these levels and what it takes to achieve them.

## Level 1: Deckhand

The first level is the Deckhand. Deckhands are responsible for on-the-ground tasks and must complete a set of activities for a month before being considered for the program. These activities include:

- **Complete 5 quests**
    Quests come in a variety of forms and include the following items. We are always open to new ideas, so let us know if you have any thoughts!
    - Post an original Koii meme
    - Tweet about Koii using the #Koiimunity hashtag
    - Answer 5 Peeranha questions thoroughly and correctly
    - Take an informal quiz about Koii Networkâ€™s technology and values
    - Connect your Finnie wallet to the faucet, get some tokens, and send KOII to a friend.

Once completed, Deckhands have the responsibility of staying involved and keeping the community engaged.

- **Core Responsibilities**
    - Be online in our Discord server at least 3 days a week
    - Spur conversation by asking and answering questions, posting Web3 news, etc.
    - Welcome new members and connect with them
    - Kick off some games, polls, surveys, and quizzes with fellow members and enjoy engaging with everyone
    - Write a tweet thread about our Twitter Space every month â€” weâ€™d love for you to listen live and ask questions in the moment, but we know that this isnâ€™t feasible for everyone.

Deckhands who complete these activities will gain access to an exclusive monthly call and receive KOII tokens every month.* 

## Level 2: Master-at-Arms

Once you have become a Deckhand, you can work towards becoming a Master-at-Arms. **You must be a Deckhand for at least two weeks** before being considered for a promotion. Masters-at-Arms are focused on training new Deckhands, attending local meetups, and helping Buccaneers run community campaigns.

- **Requirement**
    - Be a committed and engaged Deckhand for at least two weeks
    - Take a small quiz to ensure you have a high level understanding of Koiiâ€™s technology and products

- **Core Responsibilities** (including but not limited to)
    - Mingle with crypto enthusiasts at meetups in your local areas. Weâ€™ll send you Koii stickers to hand out at these events!
    - Be online in our Discord server at least 3 days a week
    - Train 10 new Deckhands to become Masters-at-Arms
    - Assist a Buccaneer with pirate missions. Here are a few examples of what you might do:
        - Ex 1) Help write an original piece of content (infographic, article, blog, tweets) about the latest Koii news 
        - Ex 2) Become a master translator for Koiiâ€™s most important content and documents
    - Participate in at least one Koii user test each month

Masters-at-Arms receive even more exclusive benefits, including invitations to exclusive online events and the ability to organize weekly calls. They also have access to pirate training, which includes biweekly group calls with a Koii team member. Theyâ€™ll receive more KOII tokens and  obtain a special Discord pirate badge.

## Level 3: Buccaneer

The most prestigious of the pirate uprising is the Buccaneer. You have proven yourself worthy to steer our ship towards success. To achieve prime status, community members must first become a Master-at-Arms before advancing to the final stage. 

- **Requirements**
    - Be a Master-at-Arms for at least one month
    - Pass an assessment to ensure you can explain the nuances of Koiiâ€™s task environment, Koii node, and settlement layer, K2. You have a deep understanding of the tech stack and are ready to take Koii to the next level. ðŸš€
 
- **Core Responsibilities** (including but not limited to)
    - Run a hackathon or meetup in your town once a month
    - Be active in our Discord server at least 3 days a week
    - Coordinate with a MaA and guide them with ways to create new content and grow our community
    - Lead a pirate mission every month
        - Recruit a Master at Arms to help run a campaign. These might include: 
            - Educational videos 
            - Translating pages on our website. 
            - Infographics
            
            The world is your oyster, letâ€™s chat about your passion and what excites you!

Buccaneers receive the most exclusive benefits, including a swag package, a paid flight to agreed-upon conferences for business development (lodging and food not included), and the opportunity to be considered first for job openings in our ecosystem. They also receive KOII tokens every month,* have access to bi-weekly video calls with the leadership team, and have rights to community moderation.

**Note:** If a Deckhand, Master-at-Arms, or Buccaneer fails to meet their responsibilities, they will lose their privileges.

## Be a Pirate, Save the World

The Koii Network pirate uprising is a great way for our most dedicated community members to get recognized and rewarded for their contributions. We're excited to see the program grow and thrive, and we look forward to working with our pirates to build an even stronger Koii Network community.

If you have any questions about the pirate program or Koii as a whole, don't be shy and give us a shout on [Discord](https://discord.gg/koii-network){:target="\_blank"}. Weâ€™ll be standing by the helm to steer you in the right direction!
