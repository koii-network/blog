At this week’s Koii Town Hall, Join UpRock's Jesse Adams - Co-founder of UpRock this Thursday for an exclusive Koii Town Hall Fireside Chat on realizing distributed networks. We'll discuss combining Koii Network's swelling desktop node network with UpRock’s army of unrestricted mobile devices to bypass restrictions of legacy systems.

The partnership between UpRock and Koii incentivizes users to share bandwidth and storage for more accurate, real-time data insights. Koii nodes have the computing power and UpRock grants geo-unfiltered access - it's a partnership enabling decentralized infrastructure to fuel unbounded AI advancement.

Together Koii x UpRock can incentivize the masses to share bandwidth and storage to fuel the needs of AI agents unlocking new passive revenue opportunities. Koii nodes have the computing power and UpRock grants geo-unfiltered access - it's a partnership enabling the future of decentralization!

Users on both platforms will be able to earn rewards sharing bandwidth and storage! When can UpRock app contributors begin earning KOII tokens by auto-contributing resources? How will Koii's global community benefit from insights across UpRock's unbounded user base?
