## Sparking Your Imagination: Potential Bugs to Hunt

We’re not just giving you a challenge—we’re giving you ideas. Here’s some food for thought to get those creative juices flowing. Remember, these are just starting points. Your imagination is the limit.

### Task Manipulation

- **The Challenge:** Can you twist a Koii Task into doing something it shouldn’t? Maybe a task meant to process data suddenly decides to skip a step or two. How would you do it?
- **Why It’s Interesting:** It’s like rerouting a train onto the wrong track—except the train is code, and the track is our decentralized network.
- **Bounty Wanted Level:** Low

### Sybil Attacks on Task Validation

- **The Challenge:** Create an army of fake nodes to influence task validation. Can you make it look like a legit operation?
- **Why It’s Interesting:** Similar to pulling off a heist in broad daylight, with everyone watching—except they don’t know they’re being robbed.
- **Bounty Wanted Level:** High

### Off-Chain Data Integrity

- **The Challenge:** Koii Tasks rely on off-chain data. Can you feed it some bad data without anyone noticing?
- **Why It’s Interesting:** Like slipping a fake document into a pile of legit ones and seeing if anyone catches it.
- **Bounty Wanted Level:** Medium

### Token Exploits

- **The Challenge:** Find a way to trick a Koii Task into mishandling tokens. Maybe you can make it transfer funds to the wrong place or even create fake transactions.
- **Why It’s Interesting:** It’s the blockchain equivalent of sleight-of-hand—can you make the tokens disappear?
- **Bounty Wanted Level:** High

### Task Coordination Attacks

- **The Challenge:** Koii Tasks are great at coordinating actions, like social media posts or reading data from third-party sites. But what if you could throw a wrench in the works? Could you get a task to post something wild or just fail altogether?
- **Why It’s Interesting:** Like playing a prank on a robot—except this robot controls decentralized applications.
- **Bounty Wanted Level:** Medium

By identifying these vulnerabilities now, you're not just securing Koii—you're laying the groundwork for future open-source developers. Each bug you find and report helps create a more stable, secure foundation for the innovative applications that will be built on Koii once it's open-sourced.

## Why Koii Tasks Are the Ultimate Playground for Your Exploits

At the heart of Koii’s network are Koii Tasks, a playground for those who love to build with decentralized systems. Unlike traditional smart contracts, which are a bit like playing with wood blocks—stacking them neatly or watching them tumble—Koii Tasks are more like building with legos. They’re complex, interactive, and capable of handling multi-step processes in real-time.

Here’s what you’re working with:

- Over 700,000 daily submissions—that’s a whole lot of data flowing through our system.
- Nearly 20,000 daily active nodes—keeping the gears turning.
- 90,000 distributed nodes—endless capacity for your decentralized apps to SCALE.

But with great power comes great responsibility (and, let’s be honest, great fun). Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to find the cracks in this intricate machine. Can you break it? We dare you to try.

## The Bug Bounty Challenge: Join the Fun

We're offering up to $10,000 for valid exploits you find, but that's just the beginning. This bug bounty program is an opportunity to make a real impact in the blockchain space. Not only do you get a chance to earn a substantial reward, but successful bug hunters will also gain exclusive access to Koii's source code—a rare look behind the curtain of an innovative decentralized system.

You'll be contributing to the security of a cutting-edge network, potentially boosting your reputation in the cybersecurity community. It's more than just a payday; it's our invitation to help us build the future of distributed technology. Win-win, right?

## Why Koii Is Different: The Strength of Distributed Resilience

What truly sets Koii apart from traditional blockchain systems is our approach to scaling and security. In conventional blockchains, miners or validators are responsible for processing transactions and maintaining the network. While this system works for cryptocurrencies, it can face scalability issues and potential centralization risks when applied to more complex, data-intensive applications.

Koii takes a different route, one that addresses these limitations by decentralizing task validation across a massive network of 90,000 distributed nodes. This approach not only enhances scalability but also increases resilience against potential attacks or collusion attempts.

Imagine a future where your smartphone doesn't just consume content, but actively earns you income by contributing to a vast, decentralized computing network. That's the kind of revolutionary infrastructure you're helping to secure and refine.

### Scaling Through Innovation: SCALEs and CARP

Koii’s architecture is underpinned by two key innovations: Succinct Curated Acyclic Ledger Extensions (SCALEs) and the Compute Attribution and Reputation Protocol (CARP). These technologies work in tandem to address some of the most pressing challenges in decentralized networks—scalability, security, and reliability—by leveraging underutilized consumer hardware.

SCALEs allow Koii to handle large event streams and dynamic audits efficiently. Instead of processing every transaction on-chain, SCALEs enable off-chain processing with periodic anchoring to public blockchains. This drastically reduces the computational load and gas fees typically associated with blockchain operations while maintaining a high level of security and transparency. SCALEs make it possible to incorporate real-world data into decentralized workflows, including social media, web data, and other oracles, which are a critical component of decentralized AI.

CARP enhances the network's security and scalability by introducing a flexible reputation system. This system reduces the need for constant, expensive audits by rewarding good behavior and efficiently identifying bad actors. Nodes that consistently perform well are trusted more, reducing the need for costly replications of work.

## Pushing Toward Fully Distributed Networks

Koii's unique architecture fundamentally alters how decentralized systems operate. The reliance on a 90,000-strong network of distributed nodes means that no single point of failure can compromise the system. Moreover, Koii Tasks—our version of off-chain smart contracts—are designed to be both flexible and secure. These tasks handle complex, multi-step processes in real-time, making them capable of supporting a wide range of applications, from decentralized social media to AI-driven services. The real challenge, and the fun part for you, is testing the limits of what these tasks can handle.

## A Secure Future with Community Involvement

By combining the robustness of SCALEs and CARP with our vast distributed network, Koii offers a highly resilient, scalable, and secure platform. But we're not resting on our laurels. Our bug bounty program is an invitation for you to explore, experiment, and push the boundaries of what Koii can do. It's your opportunity to uncover vulnerabilities, report them ethically, and help us fortify the future of decentralized networks.

As you hunt for vulnerabilities, consider this: the code you're testing could one day power decentralized social media platforms resistant to censorship, or enable AI agents to process data using a global network of smartphones instead of centralized data centers.
