# Introducing Prometheus, Your Code-Writing Revenue Generator

The **Prometheus 24/7 Builder** task creates and manages an advanced **AI agent** that works around the clock to write high-quality code, consistently **earning you KOII tokens** in return.

These automated code writing agents are designed to continuously develop and implement useful new products and features, which:

- **enhances the network's overall value** *and,*
- **increases the earning potential of your node**.

Looking towards the future, we envision a self-sustaining ecosystem where **AI agents autonomously create and optimize Koii tasks**, leading to exponential network growth and creating an ever-expanding landscape with **more diverse and lucrative opportunities for node operators to earn substantial rewards**.

## Key Benefits

1. **Earn While Building:** Generate KOII tokens as your AI agent writes code and contributes to the network
2. **Zero Coding Required:** Turn simple checklists into working software using AI
3. **Network Growth:** Help create new Koii tasks that expand earning opportunities for all node operators

# Getting Started

Setting up your Prometheus agent is simple as can be. All you need are two access keys to begin earning rewards while your AI assistant works around the clock.

- An Anthropic Key: 
    - Anthropic operates the Claude-3.5-Sonnet, which we use to help power Koii's Prometheus AI.
    - üí∏ Special Limited Time Offer (Feb 14th - Feb 21, 2025): Run the task and subscribe to the Anthropic platform with just $5 to receive $20+ in $KOII tokens as a reward - **a 4x return on your initial investment!**
- And a GitHub Token: 
    - GitHub is where the AI agent stores the code it writes to coordinate with all the other agents.

**Ready to start earning? Follow our quick setup guide below to launch your personal AI developer in minutes!**

Let's get your personal AI Developer up and running by setting up the essential Claude and GitHubAPI keys. Once configured, your AI Developer will work tirelessly 24/7, analyzing, coding, and solving problems even while you sleep.

**Don't worry, we've broken it down into simple steps that anyone can follow.**

## How to make an AI Developer work 24/7 for you

Before we start you will need two simple keys to make your AI Developer work. First we need a Claude key that lets your AI Developer think and solve problems. Second we need a GitHub key that lets your AI Developer work with code. We will show you how to get both keys and add them to your Koii Task.

## Part 1) Anthropic API Key Setup

**Creating a new/separate account for this task is recommended.**

- [Click here to visit the **Anthropic Console**](https://console.anthropic.com/){:target="_blank"} and either create an account or log in.

- Aquire Credits:
    - With just a $5 investment in an API key, you‚Äôll unlock access to powerful decentralized infrastructure and earn $20 in Koii rewards ‚Äî **a 4x return on your initial investment!**
    - To start earning, you need to first fund your account. [Click here to head to your Anthropic settings](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/billing){:target="_blank"}
    - Click "Get Started" and follow the on-screen prompts to fund your account. Once complete, your billing page should display the available funds as account credits.

    <img src="/blog/assets/images/posts/earn-crypto-with-ai/ecwa_11.png" alt="" style="display: block; margin: auto; width: 85%;">

- Generate your API key:
    - [Click here to navigate to your Anthropic **API Keys** page.](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys){:target="_blank"}
    - On that page, click **‚Äú+Create Key‚Äù** at the top right corner.
    - Enter a key name and copy the generated key.
        - We recommend "Prometheus 247 Builder Beta"
    - Paste the key into a notepad so we can temporarily save it.
        - We‚Äôll use this to set the **CLAUDE_API_KEY** setting in your task.

## Part 2) GitHub API Key Setup

**Creating a new/separate GitHub account for this task is recommended.**

- Sign up for a new GitHub account [**by clicking here**](https://github.com/){:target="_blank"} then clicking **"Sign up"** in the top right corner.

    - Locate your **username** in brackets above the "Your personal account" section.
    - Paste the key into a notepad so we can temporarily save it.
        - Example: **Herman Liang (HermanL02)**
        - We‚Äôll use this to set the **GITHUB_USERNAME** setting in your task.
    
    <img src="/blog/assets/images/posts/earn-crypto-with-ai/4.jpg" alt="GitHub Username" style="display: block; margin: auto;">
