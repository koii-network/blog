# Introducing Prometheus, Your Code-Writing Revenue Generator

The **Prometheus 24/7 Builder** task creates and manages an advanced **AI agent** that works around the clock to write high-quality code, consistently **earning you KOII tokens** in return.

These automated code writing agents are designed to continuously develop and implement useful new products and features, which:

- **enhances the network's overall value** *and,*
- **increases the earning potential of your node**.

Looking towards the future, we envision a self-sustaining ecosystem where **AI agents autonomously create and optimize Koii tasks**, leading to exponential network growth and creating an ever-expanding landscape with **more diverse and lucrative opportunities for node operators to earn substantial rewards**.

## Key Benefits

1. **Earn While Building:** Generate KOII tokens as your AI agent writes code and contributes to the network
2. **Zero Coding Required:** Turn simple checklists into working software using AI
3. **Network Growth:** Help create new Koii tasks that expand earning opportunities for all node operators

# Getting Started

Setting up your Prometheus agent is simple and free. All you need are two access keys to begin earning rewards while your AI assistant works around the clock.

    - An Anthropic Key: Anthropic operates the Claude-3.5-Sonnet AI, which we use to help power Koii's Prometheus AI. 
    - And a GitHub Token: GitHub is where the AI agent stores the code it writes to coordinate with all the other agents.

Ready to start earning? Follow our quick setup guide below to launch your personal AI developer in minutes!

Let's get your personal AI Developer up and running by setting up the essential Claude and GitHubAPI keys.

Once configured, your AI Developer will work tirelessly 24/7, analyzing, coding, and solving problems even while you sleep.

**Don't worry, it’s free and we've broken it down into simple steps that anyone can follow.**

## How to make an AI Developer work 24/7 for you

Before we start you will need two simple keys to make your AI Developer work. First we need a Claude key that lets your AI Developer think and solve problems. Second we need a GitHub key that lets your AI Developer work with code. We will show you how to get both keys and add them to your Koii Task.

## Part 1) Anthropic API Key Setup

**Creating a new/separate GitHub account for this task is recommended.**

- [Click here to visit the **Anthropic Console**](https://console.anthropic.com/){:target="_blank"} and either create an account or log in.

- Generate your API key:
    - [Click here to navigate to your Anthropic **API Keys** page.](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys){:target="_blank"}
    - On that page, click **“+Create Key”** at the top right corner.
    - Enter a key name and copy the generated key.
        - We recommend "Prometheus 247 Builder Beta"
    - Paste the key into a notepad so we can temporarily save it.
        - We’ll use this to set the **CLAUDE_API_KEY** setting in your task.

## Part 2) GitHub API Key Setup

**Creating a new/separate GitHub account for this task is recommended.**

- Sign up for a new GitHub account [**by clicking here**](https://github.com/) then clicking **"Sign up"** in the top right corner.
- Find your GitHub username:
    - Visit [**GitHub Profile Settings**](https://github.com/settings/profile).
    - Locate your **username** in brackets above the "Your personal account" section.
    - Paste the key into a notepad so we can temporarily save it.
        - Example: **Herman Liang (HermanL02)**
        - We’ll use this to set the **GITHUB_USERNAME** setting in your task.
    
    ![GitHub Username](/blog/assets/images/posts/earn-crypto-with-ai/4.jpg)
    
- Generate a personal access token:
    - Navigate to "Personal access tokens" (left-hand side) within your [**GitHub Developer Settings**](https://github.com/settings/tokens).
    - Click **"Generate new token"** at the top right.
    - Select **"Generate new token (classic)"**.
    
    ![Generate New Token](/blog/assets/images/posts/earn-crypto-with-ai/5.png)
    
    - If prompted, log in and verify your identity.
    - Set a **token name** and change the expiration to **"No expiration"**.
    - Select the "**repo**" scope to ensure full access.
    
    ![Select Repo Scopes](/blog/assets/images/posts/earn-crypto-with-ai/ecwa_6.png)
    
    - Copy the generated token.
    - Paste the token into a notepad so we can temporarily save it.
        - We’ll use this to set the **GITHUB_TOKEN** setting in your task.

## Part 3) Setting up the Koii Task

**Make sure to have the [Koii Desktop Node](https://www.koii.network/node?refCode=797CA527FE7D) installed first.**

- Open Koii Desktop Node to install the ORCA tool.
- A banner at the top of the Desktop Node should prompt you to "Install the ORCA add-on".
    - If the banner doesn't show up;
    - Navigate to Settings via the Gear icon in the top right,
    - Click on Task Extensions on the left,
    - Scroll to the bottom of the page,
    - And click "Install ORCA".

![Install the ORCA add-on](/blog/assets/images/posts/earn-crypto-with-ai/ecwa_7.png)

- Next We'll need to add the Prometheus Beta task to your Node. N
- Navigate to "+Add Task."
- Click "+Advanced" at the bottom left of the page to add the Beta version of this task.
- Paste the following Task ID into the TASK ID field:
    - `89HS9yB9KDRh8EscSR2YXdk5Wh5xyetR4y8Dm6vov51v`

![Add Task to Node](/blog/assets/images/posts/earn-crypto-with-ai/ecwa_9.png)

- Before you can run the task, you'll need to configure its extensions.
- Click the highlighted gear icon:
    
    ![Gear Icon in Node](/blog/assets/images/posts/earn-crypto-with-ai/image.png)
    
- To configure a task: click "Select an Item"
