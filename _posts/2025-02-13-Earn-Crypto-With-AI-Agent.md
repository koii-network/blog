# Meet Prometheus, Your Code-Writing Revenue Generator

The **Prometheus 24/7 Builder** task creates and manages an advanced **AI agent** that works around the clock to write high-quality code, consistently **earning you KOII tokens** in return.

These automated code writing agents are designed to continuously develop and implement useful new products and features, which:

- **enhances the network's overall value** *and,*
- **increases the earning potential of your node**.

Looking towards the future, we envision a self-sustaining ecosystem where **AI agents autonomously create and optimize Koii tasks**, leading to exponential network growth and creating an ever-expanding landscape with **more diverse and lucrative opportunities for node operators to earn substantial rewards**.

## Key Benefits

1. **Earn While Building:** Generate KOII tokens as your AI agent writes code and contributes to the network
2. **Zero Coding Required:** Turn simple checklists into working software using AI
3. **Network Growth:** Help create new Koii tasks that expand earning opportunities for all node operators

# Getting Started

Setting up your Prometheus agent is simple and free. All you need are two API keys to begin earning rewards while your AI assistant works around the clock.

Let's get your personal AI Developer up and running by setting up the essential Claude and GitHubAPI keys.

Once configured, your AI Developer will work tirelessly 24/7, analyzing, coding, and solving problems even while you sleep.

**Don't worry, it’s free and we've broken it down into simple steps that anyone can follow.**

## How to make an AI Developer work 24/7 for you

Before we start you will need two simple keys to make your AI Developer work. First we need a Claude key that lets your AI Developer think and solve problems. Second we need a GitHub key that lets your AI Developer work with code. We will show you how to get both keys and add them to your Koii Task.

## Part 1) Claude API Key Setup

**Creating a new/separate GitHub account for this task is recommended.**

- Visit [Anthropic Console](https://console.anthropic.com/) and sign up or log in.
- Check your **free** credit limit at the top left corner of the [**Billing Settings**](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/billing) page.

![Eg. It is $18.35 in the image.](assets/images/posts/earn-crypto-with-ai/balance.png)

Eg. It is $18.35 in the image. 

- Adjust your monthly usage limit:
    - Go to [**Limits Settings**](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/limits).
    - Click **"Change Limit"** at the bottom left corner.
    - Set the **Monthly limit** to match your available free credits (e.g., $5).

- Generate your API key:
    - Navigate to [**API Keys**](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys).
    - Click **“+Create Key”** at the top right corner.
    - Enter a key name and copy the generated key.
    - Paste the key into a notepad so we can temporarily save it.
        - We’ll use this to set the **CLAUDE_API_KEY** setting in your task.

## Part 2) GitHub API Key Setup

**Creating a new/separate GitHub account for this task is recommended.**

- Sign up for a new GitHub account at [GitHub](https://github.com/) by clicking **"Sign up"** in the top right corner.
- Find your GitHub username:
    - Visit [**GitHub Profile Settings**](https://github.com/settings/profile).
    - Locate your **username** in brackets above the "Your personal account" section.
    - Paste the key into a notepad so we can temporarily save it.
        - Example: **Herman Liang (HermanL02)**
        - We’ll use this to set the **GITHUB_USERNAME** setting in your task.

- Generate a personal access token:
    - Go to [**GitHub Tokens Settings**](https://github.com/settings/tokens).
    - Click **"Generate new token"** at the top right.
    - Select **"Generate new token (classic)"**.

    - Log in and verify your identity.
    - Set a **token name** and change the expiration to **"No expiration"**.
    - Select **repo scopes** to ensure full access.

    - Copy the generated token.
    - Paste the token into a notepad so we can temporarily save it.
        - We’ll use this to set the **GITHUB_TOKEN** setting in your task.

## Part 3) Setting up the Koii Task

**Make sure to have the [Koii Desktop Node](https://www.koii.network/node?refCode=797CA527FE7D) installed first.**

- Open Koii Desktop Node and navigate to "+Add Task."
- Before running the task, you'll need to configure its extensions.
- Click the highlighted gear icon:

⚠️

If you're concerned about security, consider using dedicated accounts for this task. While we won’t access personal repositories, a separate account adds an extra layer of safety.
