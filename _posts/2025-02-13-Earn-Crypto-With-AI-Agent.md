# Introducing Prometheus, Your Code-Writing Revenue Generator

The **Prometheus 24/7 Builder** task creates and manages an advanced **AI agent** that works around the clock to write high-quality code, consistently **earning you KOII tokens** in return.

These automated code writing agents are designed to continuously develop and implement useful new products and features, which:

- **enhances the network's overall value** *and,*
- **increases the earning potential of your node**.

Looking towards the future, we envision a self-sustaining ecosystem where **AI agents autonomously create and optimize Koii tasks**, leading to exponential network growth and creating an ever-expanding landscape with **more diverse and lucrative opportunities for node operators to earn substantial rewards**.

## Key Benefits

1. **Earn While Building:** Generate KOII tokens as your AI agent writes code and contributes to the network
2. **Zero Coding Required:** Turn simple checklists into working software using AI
3. **Network Growth:** Help create new Koii tasks that expand earning opportunities for all node operators

# Getting Started

Setting up your Prometheus agent is simple and free. All you need are two access keys to begin earning rewards while your AI assistant works around the clock.

- An Anthropic Key: 
    - Anthropic operates the Claude-3.5-Sonnet, which we use to help power Koii's Prometheus AI. 
- And a GitHub Token: 
    - GitHub is where the AI agent stores the code it writes to coordinate with all the other agents.

**Ready to start earning? Follow our quick setup guide below to launch your personal AI developer in minutes!**

Let's get your personal AI Developer up and running by setting up the essential Claude and GitHubAPI keys. Once configured, your AI Developer will work tirelessly 24/7, analyzing, coding, and solving problems even while you sleep.

**Don't worry, it’s free and we've broken it down into simple steps that anyone can follow.**

## How to make an AI Developer work 24/7 for you

Before we start you will need two simple keys to make your AI Developer work. First we need a Claude key that lets your AI Developer think and solve problems. Second we need a GitHub key that lets your AI Developer work with code. We will show you how to get both keys and add them to your Koii Task.

## Part 1) Anthropic API Key Setup

**Creating a new/separate GitHub account for this task is recommended.**

- [Click here to visit the **Anthropic Console**](https://console.anthropic.com/){:target="_blank"} and either create an account or log in.

- Generate your API key:
    - [Click here to navigate to your Anthropic **API Keys** page.](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys){:target="_blank"}
    - On that page, click **“+Create Key”** at the top right corner.
    - Enter a key name and copy the generated key.
        - We recommend "Prometheus 247 Builder Beta"
    - Paste the key into a notepad so we can temporarily save it.
        - We’ll use this to set the **CLAUDE_API_KEY** setting in your task.

## Part 2) GitHub API Key Setup

**Creating a new/separate GitHub account for this task is recommended.**

- Sign up for a new GitHub account [**by clicking here**](https://github.com/){:target="_blank"} then clicking **"Sign up"** in the top right corner.
- Find your GitHub username:
    - [Click here to navigate to your **GitHub Profile Settings**](https://github.com/settings/profile){:target="_blank"}.
    - Locate your **username** in brackets above the "Your personal account" section.
    - Paste the key into a notepad so we can temporarily save it.
        - Example: **Herman Liang (HermanL02)**
        - We’ll use this to set the **GITHUB_USERNAME** setting in your task.
    
    ![GitHub Username](/blog/assets/images/posts/earn-crypto-with-ai/4.jpg){: .center }
    
- Generate a personal access token:
    - Navigate to "Personal access tokens" (left-hand side) within your [**GitHub Developer Settings** (click here)](https://github.com/settings/tokens){:target="_blank"}.
    - Click **"Generate new token"** at the top right.
    - Select **"Generate new token (classic)"**.
    
    ![Generate New Token](/blog/assets/images/posts/earn-crypto-with-ai/5.png){: .center }
    
    - If prompted, log in and verify your identity.
    - Set a **token name** and change the expiration to **"No expiration"**.
    - Select the "**repo**" scope to ensure full access.
    
    ![Select Repo Scopes](/blog/assets/images/posts/earn-crypto-with-ai/ecwa_6.png){: .center }
    
    - Copy the generated token.
    - Paste the token into a notepad so we can temporarily save it.
        - We’ll use this to set the **GITHUB_TOKEN** setting in your task.

## Part 3) Setting up the Koii Task

**Make sure to have the [Koii Desktop Node installed first by clicking here.](https://www.koii.network/node?refCode=797CA527FE7D){:target="_blank"}**

- Open Koii Desktop Node to install the ORCA tool.
- A banner at the top of the Desktop Node should prompt you to "Install the ORCA add-on".
    - If the banner doesn't show up;
    - Navigate to Settings via the Gear icon in the top right,
    - Click on Task Extensions on the left,
    - Scroll to the bottom of the page,
    - And click "Install ORCA".
