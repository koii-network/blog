**Okto** is a groundbreaking chain, designed to simplify user onboarding and revolutionize cross-chain liquidity. Leveraging an embedded border product, Okto abstracts account creation by allowing users to sign up using their email or phone number, automatically generating smart wallets that enable seamless transactions without the hassle of gas fees. With a robust liquidity infrastructure, users can effortlessly swap assets across chains—from Solana to Base to Polygon, with just one click.

Okto’s platform is built on cutting-edge self-custody technology. Utilizing MPC sharding, wallet keys are split into secure shards, one stored on the user’s email server and another with the service provider, ensuring that transactions are signed only when initiated by the user. This innovative approach not only guarantees maximum security but also supports advanced multi-signature configurations. To encourage widespread adoption, Okto will offer the service free for the first six months, with cost-effective pricing thereafter based on monthly active wallets.

In a strategic move to amplify its impact, **Okto** has partnered with **Koii** - the powerhouse behind the Prometheus product line. This collaboration will integrate Prometheus’ AI-powered tools into Okto’s ecosystem, unlocking advanced features such as automated code bounties and enhanced cross-chain bridging. With Koii’s extensive network of nodes backing the initiative, Okto is set to redefine blockchain usability and drive a new era of decentralized innovation. Co-marketing efforts and technical integrations are already underway, paving the way for a seamless and transformative user experience.
