# Koii Ocean

We are thrilled to introduce the Ocean platform, a revolutionary new way for projects in the Koii ecosystem to crowdfund tokens from our growing community which now boasts over 85,000 nodes.

As our community has expanded, it has become clear that selling a large portion of tokens for each new project to VCs is not only infeasible but also creates long-term problems for both the projects and the ecosystem. To address this issue, Koii node operators can now invest directly in new projects through the Ocean protocol.

**Why the Ocean Platform?**
The traditional model of raising funds from VCs often places undue pressure on projects to deliver short-term gains, sometimes at the expense of long-term sustainability and community alignment.

By leveraging the Ocean platform, projects can bypass this hurdle, ensuring that their funding sources are more aligned with their vision and the community's interests. This decentralized crowdfunding approach democratizes investment opportunities, allowing Koii node operators to support and benefit from the projects they believe in.

**How Does It Work?**
The Ocean platform is designed to be user-friendly and efficient.

Here’s a step-by-step overview of how it works:

**Profile Creation:** Projects create a detailed profile on the Ocean platform, showcasing their vision, team, roadmap, and tokenomics.

**Community Engagement:** Engage with the Koii community through updates, AMAs, and other interactive sessions to build trust and excitement around your project.

**Fundraising Campaign:** Launch a fundraising campaign, specifying the funding goals, timeline, and reward structure for contributors.

**KYC and Compliance:** The Koii Ocean team takes care of all Know Your Customer (KYC) requirements to ensure all compliance and security requirements are met for both projects and investors.

**Token Distribution:** Once the funding goals are met, tokens are distributed to contributors, and the project receives the necessary funds to move forward.

##Upcoming Features

While the Ocean platform is currently limited to crowdfunding for Koii projects, we are excited to announce that in the coming weeks, we will expand the platform to allow a broader range of projects to participate. This means that any project within the Koii ecosystem will soon be able to create a profile and begin crowdfunding through the Ocean platform. The Koii Ocean team will handle all the complexities of KYC and fundraising, providing a seamless and secure experience for both projects and investors.

This is a unique opportunity to work directly with the Koii team and gain valuable insights into launching and scaling your project.

**The Koii Advantage**
Koii is the only platform where you can not only crowdsource the hardware and data needed to build world-changing apps but also crowdfund without selling to private investors unless required. This unique combination ensures that projects, from the beginning, can maintain greater control and alignment with their respective communities.

Through this pipeline, Koii is also equipped to help projects get their tokens listed on the upcoming release of the Orca DePINDEX, the first DePIN forward decentralized exchange on Koii.

Please note that Koii is also prepared to help projects launch tokens in testnet mode by leveraging Koii’s 85,000 nodes.
