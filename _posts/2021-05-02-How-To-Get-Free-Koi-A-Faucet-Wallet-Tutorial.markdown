# Free KOII, coming right up! A KOII faucet tutorial

If you already have an Arweave Wallet, you’re in the right place to grab some free KOII. If you don’t have an Arweave-compatible wallet yet, head on over to our Faucet. If you already have KOII, you can skip ahead to the [upload process](https://koi.rocks/register-content).

[Click here to go to the KOII faucet.](https://koi.rocks/faucet?step=0)

You already have an Arweave wallet, so click “Skip ahead” on step 1.

Then you’ll drag your new wallet keyfile onto the dashed rectangle. You can drag it directly from the Finder or File Explorer, then click “Submit.”

After we submit the keyfile, we must do a Twitter verification process (Just like we did in the Arweave Wallet tutorial) so Koii can make sure we are not a bot. Unfortunately, we can’t verify for both AR and KOII with the same tweet.
Next, click “Tweet to Verify.” A Twitter popup will appear, click “Tweet” to confirm. You will likely be logged in already from the previous Twitter confirmation.

After tweeting, click “Get KOII.” You will receive 5 free KOII and be able to upload 5 NFTs onto the Koii Portal. Be sure to sign up to recieve our [newsletter](https://openkoi.us1.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=d90823177f316ca38afbc6c61&id=b69c610637) where your NFT could be featured and start earning KOII whenever your content is veiwed!
