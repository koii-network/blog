Prometheus is thrilled to announce the integration of **Bot.Fun**, a groundbreaking knowledge architecture that transforms information into standardized, tradable data objects. Inspired by **Magic: The Gathering**, Bot.Fun categorizes insights, innovations, and AI-generated responses into **cards**, which serve as reusable knowledge units for AI agents. This revolutionary approach enhances AI efficieyeahncy by reducing redundant computations, enabling smaller consumer devices to perform AI tasks with minimal processing power.

In support of this innovation, **Koii Network and the Koii Foundation** have allocated a **$10,000 KOII testnet grant** to bootstrap **swarm technology on Koii** for Bot.Fun. This includes **Astrolink and Prometheus bounties** for publicity and code generation, ensuring robust development and adoption. With this funding, Bot.Fun will enable communities to earn rewards for querying public AI models—such as **Anthropic’s Claude, OpenAI’s ChatGPT, and Google’s Gemini**—and preserving insights as cards. These reusable knowledge units will allow AI agents to recall and refine past reasoning, dramatically improving efficiency across decentralized networks.

Bot.Fun's integration presents a **major opportunity for the Prometheus SDK**, which will leverage **smaller context windows on consumer devices**, scaling Koii’s network to a broader user base. By combining Prometheus's decentralized compute capabilities with Bot.Fun's **knowledge architecture**, this partnership lays the groundwork for a **new era of AI efficiency, accessibility, and decentralization**—ensuring a future where AI operates more effectively on a truly distributed infrastructure.
