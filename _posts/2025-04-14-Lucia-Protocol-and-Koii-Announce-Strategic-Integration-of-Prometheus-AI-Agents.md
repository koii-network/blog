Lucia Protocol, a leader in privacy-preserving Web3 marketing attribution, and Koii Network, through its Prometheus product line, today announced a strategic partnership designed to enhance decentralized marketing analytics and usability across blockchain applications. This collaboration will integrate Prometheus AI agents into Lucia’s platform, streamlining the development and continuous improvement of secure, cross-chain ad attribution models. By leveraging decentralized compute, the initiative aims to deliver scalable, transparent marketing analytics that maintain rigorous privacy standards.

Lucia’s platform, built on cutting-edge identity and ZK-Proof technologies, already provides advertisers and marketers with actionable insights into user behavior while protecting data integrity. With the integration of Prometheus, Lucia will benefit from automated code generation and optimization capabilities powered by Koii’s global network of nodes. This combination of Software and Product automation via Prometheus and Marketing and Sales Funnel optimization through Lucia makes these 2 a must-have in today’s agentic age. In addition, Prometheus agents may, in the future, utilize Lucia to track user engagement, user journey, and even user churn on dApps, allowing for automated, AI-driven improvements in usability flow and data retargeting.

This partnership reflects a shared commitment to building the next generation of decentralized tools based on trust, transparency, and community collaboration. Lucia’s goal of illuminating and clarifying marketing and business decisions by leveraging machine learning combined with Prometheus’ integration of AI agents will help in laying the groundwork for a seamless synergy of AI and Data within the Web3 space.
