Orca was founded with the vision of simplifying and democratizing access to computing power. Our team of visionary engineers and tech enthusiasts embarked on a mission to eliminate the barriers to serverless computing and make infinite scalability achievable for developers and businesses of all sizes. At Orca, we believe in the power of community and collaboration. Our growth reflects not only our technological advancements but also the strong relationships we’ve cultivated with our partners and the greater ecosystem.

With over 11 years of expertise in architecting and building highly scalable systems for both startups and enterprises, our journey into the Web3 space began four years ago. We initially collaborated with DeFi companies, focusing on their infrastructure needs. Through this work, we recognized a significant challenge: decentralization of physical infrastructure in Web3. We also identified other critical issues such as market fragmentation, lack of liquidity, and complex deployment processes that often require code rewrites.

This realization led to the creation of OrcaCompute, a solution designed to make decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN) feasible for everyday use. Our mission is to empower individuals to contribute their infrastructure in a user-friendly format, akin to a decentralized exchange (DEX). This is where DePinDex comes in—the world's first DEX specifically designed for DePINs, with a private beta launch scheduled for this month.

To streamline the integration and deployment of decentralized applications (dApps), we developed the Orca Node and Decentralized Kubernetes (DK8s), ensuring scalable and reliable deployments without the need for code rewrites. Having spent over a decade on web infrastructure projects, we understand the need for a three-fold approach to make DePINs feasible: simplifying integration, finance, and deployment.

**Integration: DK8s**   
Setting up decentralized applications can be challenging, but DK8s eliminate the need to overhaul existing systems. It seamlessly integrates with current setups, allowing developers to manage their apps across different decentralized environments effortlessly. DK8s handle the complexities that developers face so that they focus on building great apps.

**Finance: DPD**  
On the financial front, DPD bridges users and developers, facilitating effortless and secure transactions of computational resources. It enhances liquidity and enables efficient trading of infrastructure assets, making financial interactions within the ecosystem smooth and reliable.

**Deployment: Orca Nodes**  
Imagine supercharging your blockchain network to run any containerized app without rewriting your entire code. Orca Node is a core component of the Orca suite, designed to enable blockchain networks to run containerized applications seamlessly. This feature enhances the versatility and scalability of blockchain projects, providing unparalleled flexibility across industries.

**How Orca Node Works**  
Orca Node utilizes Docker containers to package software code and its dependencies into standardized executable units. This ensures consistent and reliable application performance across different computing environments, which is essential for decentralized networks operating globally.
This is already in deployment in the form of a [partnership](https://www.koii.network/blog/Koii-Network-Partners-with-ORCA) we have with Koii, which enables one-click task deployment on the network. In other words, Orca enables users to run AI models on Koii. This collaboration is set to transform how Koii tasks are deployed, managed, and executed.

**Deployment and Management**  
Developers can deploy and manage applications directly through Orca Node with minimal setup, thanks to Orca’s user-friendly interface supporting one-click deployments. This significantly simplifies the process and allows for rapid scaling.

**Integration and Scalability**  
Orca Node provides a platform where applications are easy to deploy and scale, ensuring that blockchain projects grow without encountering typical physical infrastructure limitations. This is particularly valuable for environments requiring high availability and performance.

**Security and Isolation**  
Each containerized application runs in isolation, enhancing security by minimizing the risk of interference from other processes. This isolation also aids in conflict resolution and resource management, making it easier to maintain and troubleshoot applications.

By abstracting the complexity involved in deploying and managing containerized applications, Orca Node allows developers to focus on innovation rather than infrastructure management. 

OrcaCompute is poised to transform decentralized physical infrastructure, making it accessible, scalable, and efficient for all. Join us in pioneering this revolutionary shift in the Web3 landscape.
