Our featured guest is Saim Iqbal, CEO of DataSwap. Saim brings a wealth of experience from his role as Head of Operations at Koii Network and has assembled an all-star team of machine learning researchers and experts. 

During an exclusive fireside chat, we'll dive into DataSwap's mission to democratize access to social media and AI training data. Currently, giants like Twitter and Facebook charge exorbitant fees for API access - putting it out of reach for many startups and indie developers. DataSwap bypasses these paywalls by leveraging community resources to acquire public social data at a fraction of the cost.

But how exactly does it work? Saim will shed light on DataSwap's unique approach, including:
The "Dataset Marketplace" where users can buy, sell, and swap curated datasets
Offering both raw data (like HTML for training) and processed, analysis-ready formats
Providing fully customized datasets tailored to specific use cases and verticals

We'll also explore some of the fascinating applications of DataSwap's offerings. From an aggregated news model drawing from multiple platforms to real-time financial insights based on influential Twitter users, the possibilities are endless. Saim will share real-world examples of how customers are leveraging DataSwap to build groundbreaking AI solutions.

Of course, with great data comes great responsibility. The conversation will touch on DataSwap's commitment to user privacy, data compliance, and ethical AI practices. In an era of increasing scrutiny around data collection and usage, transparency is paramount.
Looking ahead, Saim will discuss DataSwap's ambitious roadmap. With a recent fundraise and partnerships like Zevenue fueling growth, the team is laser-focused on expanding to new data sources and hiring top talent to meet surging demand.

Join us for what promises to be an enlightening and thought-provoking session. Will DataSwap emerge as the default provider for the booming generative AI sector? How can affordable, scalable data access change the game for startups aiming to compete with Big Tech? Bring your burning questions for the Q&A!

The Koii Town Hall featuring Saim Iqbal from DataSwap takes place this Thursday at 15:00 UTC. RSVP on the Luma calendar below.
