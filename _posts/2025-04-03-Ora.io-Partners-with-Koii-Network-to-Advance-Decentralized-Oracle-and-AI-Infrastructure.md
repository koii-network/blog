Ora.io, a pioneering decentralized oracle platform built to bring verifiable AI for smart contracts across multiple blockchains, today announced a strategic partnership with Koii Network. Ora.io has spent 2024 establishing its oracle-based system across 11 EVM chains, laying the foundation for secure, real-time data feeds essential to powering AI-driven financial and public-good applications. As one team member noted, “we spent all of 2024 really setting up that info across 11 EVM chains through this oracle based system,” reflecting their commitment to building a robust, cross-chain infrastructure.

This collaboration leverages Koii Network’s Prometheus framework to integrate Ora.io’s agent SDK with a decentralized network of node operators. The partnership will enable secure, isolated Docker container deployments for trading strategies and other use cases, while ensuring that sensitive funds remain protected within smart contracts. “We already have the tokenomics methods in the background. Distributing tokens for work that's done on a computer is kind of our bread and butter,” said Al Morris, emphasizing the efficiency and scalability offered by Koii’s decentralized compute model. Ora.io’s approach ensures that each agent operates independently, supporting verifiable AI workflows that underpin next-generation smart contract applications.

Looking ahead, Ora.io and Koii Network plan to deepen integration through a series of developer webinars, town halls, and targeted token incentive programs. This joint initiative aims to bring community members into the ecosystem, allowing them to contribute spare computing capacity via personal devices and earn rewards while securely processing decentralized tasks. By combining Ora.io’s advanced oracle capabilities with Koii’s distributed infrastructure, the partnership seeks to build an open, transparent, and scalable environment for AI-powered smart contracts—paving the way for a more efficient and collaborative decentralized future.
