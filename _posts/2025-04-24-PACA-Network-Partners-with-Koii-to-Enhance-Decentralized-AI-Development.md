Alpaca Network, an open, decentralized platform for hosting Hugging Face algorithms, has announced a strategic partnership with Koii to advance AI development within the Web3 ecosystem. This collaboration enables users to tokenize and NFT-ify their preferred Hugging Face models, launching AI agents with strong DeFi fundamentals and decentralized infrastructure.

Through Koii’s recently released Prometheus product line, Alpaca Network will integrate AI-powered code-building agents, allowing users to write, configure, and enhance AI codebases autonomously. This will make Alpaca Network’s AI technology more accessible and user-friendly, enabling anyone to design and deploy AI agents. Additionally, Alpaca Network will host its AI infrastructure on Koii, leveraging Koii’s expertise in ZK and DevOps technologies to ensure a secure, transparent, and fully decentralized AI future.

Notably, Alpaca Network’s Canadian roots make it the fourth Canadian team to join the Prometheus network, reinforcing North America’s growing leadership in decentralized AI solutions. As this partnership unfolds, Koii and Alpaca will continue to push the boundaries of open AI, Web3 innovation, and decentralized compute infrastructure.
