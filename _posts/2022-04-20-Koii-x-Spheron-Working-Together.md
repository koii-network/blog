It's hard to argue against the case for web3 and decentralization. Without these technologies, information freedom can never really be guaranteed. Despite knowing this, however, we continue to live in a predominantly Web2 oriented world. Why is there resistance to decentralization, and what are we doing to actively mitigate it?

One reason for this resistance is that building decentralized applications is challenging. That's why Koii is building tools like the [Koii-X templates](https://docs.koii.network/build-dapps-with-koii/welcome-to-koii-x){:target="\_blank"} to make building dApps easier. With Koii-X, you can have a customized dApp ready to go in about 10 minutes. After that, your new application is ready to be deployed from the command line, or, with an automated deployment service.

## Using Spheron to Deploy a Koii dApp

One option for automated deployment is to use Spheron to launch your dApp or website directly onto a decentralized storage provider like Arweave. Spheron automates the process and doesn't require new code to deploy your application. Deploying with Spheron also provides several additional unique advantages:

- Deployment can be done directly from GitHub, Bitbucket, or GitLab, making it easy for teams to collaborate and deploy their applications.
- Spheron provides a unique dashboard interface that stores the links to deployed pages for developers
- Domain names can be easily integrated into your deployment, keeping addresses readable and easy to verify
- For a limited time, it is free to deploy on Arweave using Spheron

Making dApps easier to build and deploy is essential to attracting more developers and users to Web3. We’re excited to be working alongside Spheron to make building and deploying decentralized applications easier than ever before.

To see how easy it can be to develop a dApp using a Koii-X template please see our [written](https://blog.koii.network/Deploy-your-own-crowdfunding-portal-in-10-minutes-using-Koii-X/){:target="\_blank"} or [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBJDM_ZY2WI){:target="\_blank"} tutorials. Once you’re ready to deploy you can check out our guide on how to [deploy your Koii-X template directly from Github using Spheron](https://blog.koii.network/Deploying-your-Koii-X-template-with-Spheron/){:target="\_blank"}.
