# $5m in Bonus $KOII for Task Nodes 

This week we unveiled an entirely new type of Koii Task – one that rewards you for running other tasks!\
\
The Koii Foundation has allocated a huge portion of the Koii Ecosystem Fund to support new projects on Koii with extra rewards in $KOII.\
\
Look for the glowing gold task in your ‘Add Tasks’ screen.

# How does it work?

There are a lot of awesome tasks on Koii, each backed by amazing ecosystem projects, but we wanted to give the community an extra reward for supporting new tasks and mining their tokens. Now, when you run certain tasks, you’ll also receive a bonus in $KOII on top of KPL token rewards. It’s simple to join, and all you need is the [Koii Desktop Node](http://koii.network/node):

1) Run the **Bonus Task** and stake at least 10 KOII

2) Run any (or all) of the following tasks

   1. Free Fire Task

   2. Mask Social Feeds

   3. Big Big Task

   4. Astrolink Task

   5. Inflation Monitoring

   6. Dangerous Dave (must post a screenshot after passing level 4)

3) Now, every time your node makes a submission on these other tasks, you’ll receive bonus rewards in $KOII from the Bonus TaskBOOM! Free $KOII, just for supporting the great projects you already know and love. Keep those nodes turned on, because we’re just getting started!

## What’s Next?

Our mission at Koii has always been to support independent developers as they build towards the decentralized future, and we want you, the Koii community, to be involved with us.
\
The Bonus Task is the first step towards this vision, and while this MVP is managed by the Koii Labs team, we will be adding voting controls so that you can also add your input to the mix.\
\
Starting around February 14, 2025, you’ll be able to show your love for ecosystem projects by voting on which tasks will receive the bonus tokens. Your voting power will depend on how much you stake on the bonus task, and how long you’ve been staking, so don’t hesitate, head over to your node and join the Bonus Task today!
