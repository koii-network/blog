Continuing to lead the way as a decentralized compute network, Koii Network, recently partnered with [Adot](https://a.site/){:target="\_blank"}, a Web3 search engine. The partnership will see Koii Network provide the infrastructure solution for Adot’s compute and data needs, enabling them to build a more efficient, AI-powered, decentralized search engine.

"We are pleased to welcome Adot to the Koii ecosystem family," said Koii Network CEO Al Morris. "With decades of experience in search engine design at Google, Wei and his team are uniquely prepared to build the peer-to-peer web that we all hope to see. His deep insight on AI and search have made this partnership truly illuminating, and working with a project of this caliber has helped us shape product and technical decisions to leapfrog to the front of the AI revolution."

The partnership between Koii Network and Adot is a major step forward for both projects. It empowers the Koii community to take part in the internet economy as suppliers, not just consumers. Together, the two companies have crafted a new form of web crawler, establishing Koii’s nodes as the data backbone for the future of the internet and allowing Adot to revolutionize search.
