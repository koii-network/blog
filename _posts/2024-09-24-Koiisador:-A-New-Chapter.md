## Who are the Koiisadors?

Koii Ambassadors, also known as Koiisadors, are the elite force of the Koii community. Imagine the sharpness of the top minds in the tech world blended with the determination of an elite task force. If you need someone to take Koii to the next level, you need a Koiisador.

If a Navy SEAL and a Jedi Master teamed up to create a protégé, it would be a Koiisador. If the brightest minds of Silicon Valley came together to design the ultimate innovator, that creation would likely grow to be a Koiisador. You get the idea. Koiisadors are exceptional, and they’re poised to champion Koii's mission on a global scale.

## Why Now?

For Koii to reach its full potential, we need you to be involved. As the proverb goes, "If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together."

The Koii community is filled with intelligent, creative, and driven individuals. Together, we can make Koii's decentralized vision a reality. The Koiisador Program is designed for those who want to contribute directly to the growth and development of the Koii ecosystem.

We have set ambitious goals for 2024 and beyond, and we need your help to achieve them.

## Advancement in the Koiisador Program

## What Will You Do?

The main goal of the Koiisador Program is to drive Koii. Whether it’s forming partnerships, hosting events, or developing content, we need your unique skill set to help spread Koii’s mission.

Ambassadors contribute in one of four core roles:

- **Event Host**: Organize and run online or in-person Koii events. You will introduce new members to Koii and DeFi, and foster a growing community of Koii developers and users. You'll also help establish Koii hubs around the world.
- **Community Champion**: As a generalist, you'll be active on social media, in crypto communities, and in networking opportunities. You'll lead initiatives, help new users, and spread Koii’s message.
- **Content Creator**: Create blogs, guides, videos, or graphics to explain Koii’s ecosystem to the world. You’ll need to submit examples of your work, and all content must be approved by the Koii team.
- **Tech Ambassador**: If you’re a tech expert, help the community by answering technical questions, creating tutorials, and assisting with node setups. This role requires proven technical skills and contributions.
