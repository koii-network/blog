_March 2025_ — **Bio Protocol** is on a mission to decentralize and accelerate scientific discovery in fields such as medicine and environmental science. By harnessing an agentic science approach, Bio.xyz deploys AI research agents to parse academic literature, generate innovative hypotheses, and design experimental plans, driving forward breakthroughs in real time.

These AI-driven agents streamline complex research processes, allowing scientists to focus on high-level insights rather than routine data processing. Bio.xyz’s platform automates key steps in the research workflow, transforming vast amounts of information into actionable scientific knowledge.

Supporting this vision, **Prometheus** - powered by **Koii,** provides the decentralized infrastructure that enables community node operators to contribute spare computing capacity. This partnership ensures that Bio.xyz’s research agents run efficiently across a global network of personal devices, accelerating research and fostering a transparent, trust-based ecosystem for decentralized science.
