At Koii, we are always looking to make our products, and Web3 more generally, better and easier to use. As a part of our continuous commitment to these goals, you can now use Web3.Storage as the storage layer for your Koii tasks. This integration unlocks numerous possibilities for decentralized data storage within the Koii ecosystem.

## What is Web3.Storage?

Web3.Storage is a service provided by Protocol Labs that makes it easy for developers to interact with the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) and Filecoin. By offering a straightforward API, it empowers you to store data in a secure and decentralized manner, enriching your applications with the robustness and accessibility of the distributed web.

## A Powerful Synergy

Koii Tasks, off-chain computition that are verified and submitted on-chain, provide an innovative framework where creators and consumers interact to create, complete, and earn KOII tokens through various tasks by running desktop node. With the integration of Web3.Storage, we are bolstering this framework by introducing enhanced efficiency and resilience in the way data associated with these tasks is stored and retrieved.

To make sure your Koii tasks work, you'll need your own Web3.Storage key. We'll walk you through the process of getting one below.
