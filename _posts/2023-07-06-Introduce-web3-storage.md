The Koii Network is always on the lookout for opportunities to enhance the user experience and functionality of our platforms. As a part of our continuous commitment to these goals, Koii Tasks is integrating with Web3.Storage for improved data organization. This integration unlocks numerous possibilities for decentralized data storage within the Koii ecosystem.

## What is Web3.Storage?

Web3.Storage is a service provided by Protocol Labs that allows developers to interact with the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) and Filecoin. By offering a straightforward API, it empowers you to store data in a secure and decentralized manner, thus enriching your applications with the robustness and accessibility of the distributed web.

## Koii Tasks and Web3.Storage: A Powerful Synergy

Koii Tasks, off-chain computations that are verified and submitted on-chain, is a platform where creators and consumers can create and complete tasks to earn KOII tokens. With the integration of Web3.Storage, we are introducing the efficiency and resilience to the way data associated with these tasks is stored and retrieved.

For this integration to work and to ensure the seamless operation of Koii Tasks, you'll need your own Web3.Storage key. Below, we walk you through the process of obtaining it.
