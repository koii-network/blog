We are thrilled to announce a strategic partnership between Koii Network and Exabits. This partnership marks a significant milestone in the expansion of decentralized computing resources. The collaboration between the two companies is poised to revolutionize the Web3 and AI landscapes as Exabits’ high-performance computing capabilities are integrated with Koii’s decentralized infrastructure.

**Highlights from the partnership**

Integration of compute resources\
Exabits will provide Koii Network with access to its extensive GPU clusters. This significantly enhances  the computational power available to the node operators on Koii.

Tokenized compute economy\
Koii’s node operators will be able to leverage Exabits' computing resources by holding and utilizing Exabits tokens. This system brings seamless access to high-performance computing power and supports the growth and execution of new decentralized projects.

API and voucher system\
The partnership will explore multiple integration methods, including API access for on-demand compute resources and a voucher system that allows node operators to redeem computing hours using NFTs. This flexibility ensures a streamlined experience for all participants.

Expansion of services****Beyond GPU resources, the collaboration will explore the provision of other computing needs, such as CPU machines and storage solutions, further broadening the scope of services available to Koii’s network.

Supporting founders****This partnership aligns with Koii’s mission to assist new founders by providing the necessary compute resources to launch and scale their projects without significant upfront capital, thus fostering innovation and growth in the decentralized ecosystem.

**Moving forward**  
This partnership aims to begin with a provisional agreement, testing the integration through API access and progressively moving toward a more comprehensive collaboration. Koii and Exabits will work closely to survey the demand from node operators and develop a reserved instance purchasing plan to ensure stable and scalable access to computing power.

This is a significant advancement in decentralized computing that combines the strengths of both organizations to deliver unparalleled resources and support to the Web3 community. This partnership is set to drive innovation, reduce barriers to entry, and provide a robust foundation for the next generation of  dApps.
