Prometheus is proud to welcome Acurast to the ecosystem, joining forces to provide decentralized AI development on thousands of devices, extending existing Koii offerings. This strategic collaboration aims to enhance the capabilities of Prometheus's existing network by introducing Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) for confidential and verifiable computations, thereby broadening the scope of decentralized cloud services.

Acurast's innovative approach leverages mobile hardware to create a truly decentralized compute layer, empowering both Web2 and Web3 applications with secure and scalable solutions. By transforming everyday mobile devices into trustless compute nodes, Acurast ensures confidential and verifiable computations without reliance on centralized servers.Â  This integration enables Koii node operators within the Prometheus network to complement their existing public computation services with private computation capabilities, addressing specific guarded secrets and enhancing data security.

The collaboration between Acurast and Prometheus lays the foundation for a broader range of tools and services, including enterprise-level solutions and advanced systems engineering improvements. By combining Acurast's confidential compute infrastructure with Prometheus's robust network, this partnership is set to redefine the landscape of decentralized cloud computing, offering scalable, secure, and community-driven alternatives to traditional cloud services.
