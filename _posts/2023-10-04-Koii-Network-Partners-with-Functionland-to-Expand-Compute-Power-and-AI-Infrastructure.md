Expanding their growing ecosystem, Koii Network, a leading provider of compute power and AI infrastructure, is announcing a partnership with [Functionland](https://fx.land/){:target="\_blank"}, a provider of custom hardware for compute-intensive applications. The partnership allows Koii to expand its node network dramatically, enabling the community to use Functionland’s custom hardware in addition to their personal devices. Functionland's existing network of hundreds of nodes is growing fast, paving the way for a truly peer-to-peer web backbone.

"We are excited to welcome Functionland into the Koii family," said Koii Network CEO Al Morris. "This partnership will make it easier for many people to run and set up Koii nodes, while providing passive income to Functionland’s existing users."

This partnership is a major step forward for both companies. It will allow Koii to expand its reach and offer its customers even more power to create passive income streams, while supplying more compute and data to the AI and Web3 companies who need it. It  allows Functionland to reward its customers with even more ways to put their compute and data capabilities to good use.

This partnership is a great example of two teams pushing the envelope to create a better solution for their communities. Functionland and Koii Network joining forces puts them in a perfect position to serve the fast-growing demand for compute power and AI infrastructure. An exciting future is ahead!
