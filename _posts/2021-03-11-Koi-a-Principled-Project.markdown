Koii, although in its infancy, has changed shape many times. Iteration is necessary as we push for strategic capital and align with our [ecosystem partners](https://www.arweave.org/). Other changes manifested when new opportunities within the blockchain space were quickly addressed. [The effort](https://blog.openkoi.com/Yield-Farming-for-NFTs/) better positions the Koii Protocol and its applications for meaningful adoption. All of this adaptive progress is occurring alongside the development of the Koii testnet.

**_Despite this rapid change, Koii remains true to its founding principles._**

### Open, Verified, Permanent

Early development has not affected Koii's ideals around open, verifiable, and permanent information. Koii is a principled project with a large vision. The solidity of those principles despite challenges is something we're excited about at Open Koii.

Developments and ideas around network applications consistently converge on Koii's principles. We see this convergence as validation that the principles are universally understood and practical.

**_Grounded idealism combined with execution is a unique force of nature._**

Koii's vision of an open, verifiable, and permanent information system has inspired the interest of a diverse community. Equally diverse are the reasons why the Koii Protocol provokes such inspiration. Individuals focus on those aspects of Koii which motivate their personal creativity and idealism. The implications of the Koii Protocol span many domains. This creates a unique opportunity for a robust and collaborative ecosystem to grow.

### Next Steps

We must now establish awareness around Koiiâ€™s foundational principles for the good of our community. We aim to cultivate a community where members maintain a sense of these principles over time. As a result of this understanding, individuals are empowered to move Koii forward in new and bold ways.

To accomplish this, we will release lightweight educational materials here on our website and on our community [Discord](https://discord.gg/{{ site.discord.invite }}) chat. This information will also be circulated on other platforms when relevant.

Awareness of our principles is the foundation from which our community grows. We look forward to building on these principles and seeing some truly great innovations emerge. _Onward._
